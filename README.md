# Robust mean and covariance estimation for functional snippets

This is the robust modification of the R package, [mcfda](https://github.com/linulysses/mcfda), by replacing the local linear smoother to the M-type local linear smoother for mean and variance function.

To use this package, you require an additional package `robfpca`. 
You can also download using the command `devtools::install_github("statKim/robfpca")`
    
This is not complete version, and we stopped this project.


## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("statKim/robfpca")    # It should be required.
devtools::install_github("statKim/mcfda.rob")
```
