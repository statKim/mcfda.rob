# Robust mean and covariance estimation for functional snippets

This is the robust modification of the R package, [mcfda](https://github.com/linulysses/mcfda), by replacing the local linear smoother to the M-type local linear smoother for mean and variance function.

This is not complete version, and we stopped this project.


## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("statKim/mcfda.rob")
```
